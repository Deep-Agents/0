title: Solving Pommerman with Deep Reinforcement Learning
---

Reinforcement learning has been used to solve a number of challenging games recently. That said, there are many games that are as of yet unsolved or require a lot of domain knowledge in order to create intelligent agents. Pommerman, a bomberman clone ([further described here](/pom_info/)) provides a simple environment with fun and intuitive dynamics which are surprisingly deep.

# Problem Summary

How can we train agents capable of working and communicating together in a 2v2 competition? That is one of the core questions of the Pommerman competition this year (2019). Each agent must learn to not only manage aggressive strategies that can result in accidental suicide, it must also learn to predict and account for the actions of its teammate and enemies.
