To evaluate the performance of each of our models discussed in [agents](/agents/), we propose a evaluation environment which is a 2v2 team environment with 36 wooden blocks and having no rigid blocks or powerups.

Agents are made to compete in the following contests for 100 episodes each and the win, loss and the tie percentage are plotted.

1. Agent and static agent vs Two random agents
